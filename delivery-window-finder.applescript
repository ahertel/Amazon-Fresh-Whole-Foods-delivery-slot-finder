INSTRUCTIONS:

6. Click 'Continue'. After you answer the prompts, the tool will start searching for slots

DISCLAIMER:
-
No guarantee that slots will be found and/or that slots will work. Often you will select a slot but the page will refresh and the slot will disappear. These phantom slots are very common and are in Amazon's control, not mine.  Eventually a slot should work. Some users report success of after 20+ tries. Wishing you resilience and hope!
 
FEEDBACK:
-
Post any concerns/feedback on GitHub issue page"
