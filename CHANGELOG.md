## Changelog

* #### New interface - added 4/6/20
  * Improve user experience to accompany new features
* #### Text message notifications - added 4/6/20
  * You can now get text messages when a slot is found. Added by popular demand, despite limitated utility: If you set the recipient to the same number linked to your Mac's 'Messages' app, you may not be notified on your phone as the texts may be automatically marked as read. Thus it's recommended that you enter a different phone number from the one linked to your 'Messages' app (e.g your google voice number that forwards to your real number, a family member's number, your work cell-phone)
* #### Automatically handle unknown pages - added 4/6/20
  * Amazon.com sometimes redirects the URL of the delivery slot page to the Amazon homepage, and previously the tool would require a manual restart. Now it automatically navigates back the delivery slot page whenever an unknown page is encountered. One step closer to this program running without needing any monitoring/intervention

* #### Auto-ignore out of stock items -  added 3/31/20
  * Amazon.com displays notices when items in your cart go out of stock. Now the tool can automatically ignore these warnings so it keep looking for slots without your intervention.
